# AssemblyJam
Godot Wild Jam #53


## What could have been done better (by Ktosox):
terminals – they ended up criminally underused – we should have spread them throughout the level to explain how the game operates to the player

communication – the floating heads are weapon unlocks, this was never explained to the player - even a simple floating text saying “weapon unlocked” upon pick up would have been very helpful

bullet color – late change to background should have been followed by an adjustment of the bullet color – literally 3 clicks to fix this

levers - production ready but not used in game :/

we wanted puzzles – but the game was not in a state that allowed for developing them, since features were still in flux hours from the deadline

Tile-set – we should have used a 3x3 auto tile placeholder from the very begging, this would allow for level prototyping much earlier on, and the placeholder file would be later replaced by simply swapping a file, resulting in a seamless transition

homing missiles should have been destructible objects – it would be super cool and easy to implement

player controller - the code ended up far uglier than I initially hoped, and making it work took away precious time which could have been invested into fine tuning the movement

no key re-binding

no audio settings

## What I believe dragged us down:
not enough testing time – this resulted in a lot of loose ends that lowered the overall experience

lack of coordination – we should have kept better track of assets, features and tasks

the game designer role was left vacant – we all offered suggestions and threw idea around, but the end result feels more like a collection of features rather than a coherent whole

*In the end - I'm happy with how it came out. Being a part of a team was fun. Seeing how the creativity of multiple people coalesces in to a game was enjoyable. And if I tried to make the music / art / level / VO by myself I'm certain that the end result would have been far worse than what we made together.*
